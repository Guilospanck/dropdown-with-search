# Dropdown with search vanilla JS

Simple dropdown with search made using vanilla JavaScript. This should not be used in production whatsoever, it's only a PoC that shows some custom implementation that can be done using only plain vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation

Just drag and drop the `index.html` into a browser tab.

To search for something, hit enter after input some text in the search bar when the dropdown is opened.
